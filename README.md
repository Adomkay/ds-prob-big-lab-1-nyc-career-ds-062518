# ds-prob-big-lab-1

Here goal is to review all probability material, paying attention to how to use permutations and combinations, to calculate probability -- both methods, see lecture notes in resources

Also for students to see when to use conditional probability vs bayes rule and get practice with both

Then for students to be able to test for independence, and how to move forward after asserting independence
